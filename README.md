# **Coronavirus Tweet Analysis Project**

In this project, I scanned all geotagged tweets sent in 2020 to monitor for the spread of Covid-19 on social media. These tweets were partitioned by tweet country code and language. The `viz` folder contains files ending in `.lang` and `.country` and displays the tweet counts for each hashtag. Only the top ten countries or languages are displayed.\
I utilized parallel computing, shell scripting, and worked with big data to complete this project.
